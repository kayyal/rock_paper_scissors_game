# Rock Paper Scissors Game in Flutter

This project is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game built using Flutter. The game consists of 5 rocks, 5 papers, and 5 scissors, which are square containers with different colors, textures, and images to differentiate them. The objects are randomly placed on the screen and start moving in random directions. When two objects collide, they bounce off the screen boundaries or interact according to the game rules.
